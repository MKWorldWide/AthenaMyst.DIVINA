# Migration Notes

This document outlines the changes made during the repository rehabilitation and any necessary migration steps.

## Changes Made

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Updates
- Upgraded all GitHub Actions to their latest versions
- Added caching for npm and pip dependencies
- Implemented concurrency controls to cancel outdated workflow runs
- Split the CI workflow into separate jobs for linting, testing, and building
- Added Python testing with coverage reporting
- Integrated Codecov for test coverage visualization

### 2. Documentation
- Updated README.md with current project information and setup instructions
- Set up MkDocs for documentation with GitHub Pages deployment
- Added a documentation workflow that builds and deploys the site on push to main branches

### 3. Development Environment
- Added pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
- Standardized on Node.js 20.x and Python 3.11
- Added development dependencies for linting and formatting

### 4. Testing
- Added test coverage reporting for Python code
- Improved test configuration and reliability
- Added link checking for documentation

## Migration Steps

### For Developers

1. **Update Node.js and Python**
   - Ensure you have Node.js 20.x and Python 3.11 installed
   - Consider using `nvm` (Node Version Manager) and `pyenv` to manage versions

2. **Update Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install Node.js dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Install Python dependencies
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

3. **Set Up Pre-commit Hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

### For CI/CD

1. **Required Secrets**
   - `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For uploading test coverage reports

2. **Environment Variables**
   - `NODE_ENV`: Set to `test` for testing
   - `PYTHONPATH`: May need to be set for Python imports

### For Documentation

1. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   # Install documentation dependencies
   pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin mkdocs-git-authors-plugin
   
   # Serve documentation locally
   mkdocs serve
   ```

2. **Updating Documentation**
   - Edit files in the `docs/` directory
   - The site will automatically rebuild on changes when using `mkdocs serve`
   - Documentation is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on push to main branches

## Known Issues

- Some test dependencies may need to be installed manually
- Python package dependencies may need to be updated based on your environment

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback these changes:

1. Revert the commit with the repository rehabilitation changes
2. Restore any modified configuration files from a previous commit
3. Update the CI/CD workflows if needed

## Future Improvements

- Add more comprehensive end-to-end tests
- Set up automated dependency updates with Dependabot
- Add performance testing
- Improve documentation with more examples and tutorials
